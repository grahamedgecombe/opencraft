# OpenCraft
OpenCraft is an open-source third-party implementation of the
[Minecraft Classic][classic] server software. (In fact, if my memory serves me
correctly, I believe it was the first open-source one, but feel free to prove me
wrong if that's not the case! It was certainly one of the first in any case.)

This is a conversion of the original Subversion repository hosted on
[SourceForge][sf] to Git. After development of this version stalled, a fork
named OpenCraft-ACM was created, which is now the 'official' version - it's
available on [Gitorious][gitorious].

The line endings and encoding have been converted to UNIX-style and UTF-8
respectively. In the original OpenCraft repository, DOS-style and ISO-8859-1
were used.

**This code is old and parts of it are pretty terrible. It is here for reference
only. [Lightstone][lightstone] is much better.**
